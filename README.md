# PortraitOfRuinTracker
EmoTracker Package for Portrait Of Ruin

First pass at an Item/Location tracker for Portrait of Ruin randomizers.  If you find any believed errors please create an issue and attach an image of the full tracker with what you believe the problem is. I definitely belive there are logic issues as the item access routes are incredibly complex, especially around sequence breaks.

Also, please note that not every spawn location for items will always have an item.  There is also at least one item that only appears to spawn in Randomizers and not in the base game.

For reference:
- Green means the location is accessable without squence breaks
- Yellow means the location is accessable via squence breaks
- Orange means the location is partially accessable (at least one item at the location can be gotten without squence breaks)
- Blue means the location is visable but not accessable
- Red means the location is not currently accessable
